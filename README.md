Nemo
====
Nemo is a free and open-source software and official file manager of the Cinnamon desktop environment. 
It is a fork of GNOME Files (formerly named Nautilus).

Nemo also manages the Cinnamon desktop.
Since Cinnamon 6.0 (Mint 21.3), users can enhance their own Nemo with Spices named Actions.


History
====
Nemo started as a fork of the GNOME file manager Nautilus v3.4. Version 1.0.0 was released in July 2012 along with version 1.6 of Cinnamon,
reaching version 1.1.2 in November 2012.

Developer Gwendal Le Bihan named the project "nemo" after Jules Verne's famous character Captain Nemo, who is the captain of the Nautilus.
